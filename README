Python for .NET
===============

This repository contains some compiled versions of the excellent Python for .NET library - http://pythonnet.sourceforge.net/

Python for .NET is a package that gives Python programmers nearly seamless integration with the .NET Common Language Runtime (CLR) and provides a powerful application scripting tool for .NET developers. Using this package you can script .NET applications or build entire applications in Python, using .NET services and components written in any language that targets the CLR (Managed C++, C#, VB, JScript).
