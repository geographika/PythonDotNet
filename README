Python for .NET is a package that gives Python programmers nearly seamless integration with the .NET Common Language Runtime (CLR) 
and provides a powerful application scripting tool for .NET developers. Using this package you can script .NET applications or build 
entire applications in Python, using .NET services and components written in any language that targets the CLR (Managed C++, C#, VB, JScript).
